# Straight Edge on Xion

![Xion Network Logo](./cover-art.png)

## Project Overview
A lightweight, gamified DApp built on Xion Network that rewards users with testnet tokens for simple interactions. The vision for `Straight Edge` from [The Sarcastic Geeks Trybe ðŸš€](https://x.com/sarcasticgeek4u) is to onboard as many users to xion network using the easiest onchain gaming, leveraging the surge that telegram gaming had enjoyed in the past as a result of the web2 authentication.

The difference here is that, unlike the telegram which were not strictly onchain, `Straight Edge` records the [transactions onchain](https://explorer.burnt.com/xion-testnet-1/account/xion1y3mc9j767lmnc0fx3jl6zur0klprmywth45evd). 

This is the first version of the app, the Community promises more interactive games like puzzles, maze, NFT game assets, etc. while maintaining the onchain point records.

### The app features:
